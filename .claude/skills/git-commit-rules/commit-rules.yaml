scopes:

    patterns:
      - "packages/frontend/**"

  backend:
    description: "Changes to packages/backend (NestJS API)"
    patterns:
      - "packages/backend/**"

  infra:

    patterns:
      - "packages/infra/**"

    description: "Configuration changes (TypeScript configs, environment configs)"
    patterns:
      - "config/**"
      - "*.config.*"
      - "tsconfig*.json"

  monorepo:
    description: "Changes affecting multiple packages or workspace root"
    patterns:
      - "package.json"
      - "packages/*/package.json"

  tools:
    description: "Developer tooling (git hooks, scripts, linters)"
    patterns:
      - ".githooks/**"
      - "scripts/**"
      - ".eslintrc*"
      - ".prettierrc*"

conventions:
  subject:
    - "Use imperative mood: 'Add feature' not 'Added feature'"
    - "Capitalize first letter when plain English (e.g., 'Add feature')"
    - "Don't capitalize if it starts with backticks, code, or special characters"
    - "No period at the end"
    - "Be specific but concise"

  body:
    - "Separate from subject with blank line"
    - "Explain what and why, not how"
    - "Wrap at 100 characters"

  footer:
    - "Breaking changes: 'BREAKING CHANGE: description'"
    - "Issue references: 'Refs #123' or 'Closes #123'"

special_cases:
  multi_package:
    scope: "monorepo"

  breaking_change:
    footer_required: true
    footer_format: "BREAKING CHANGE: <description>"

examples:
  feature_with_tests:
    description: "New feature with comprehensive test coverage"
    type: "feat"
    scope: "frontend"
    subject: "Add expense edit functionality"
    body: |
      - Add edit button to expense items
      - Create inline edit form with keyboard support
      - Add Playwright E2E tests for edit workflow
      - Ensure Escape cancels edit, Enter saves
    rationale: "Body uses bullet points to list specific changes, includes test additions, mentions keyboard accessibility"

  bug_fix:
    description: "Simple bug fix"
    type: "fix"
    scope: "backend"
    subject: "Prevent duplicate expense creation"
    body: |
      Add transaction-level uniqueness constraint to prevent race condition
      when multiple requests create the same expense simultaneously.

      Refs #42
    rationale: "Body explains the 'why' (race condition), includes issue reference"

  refactor_multi_package:
    description: "Refactoring across multiple packages"
    type: "refactor"
    scope: "monorepo"
    subject: "Standardize error handling across packages"
    body: |
      - Implement unified error response format
      - Update frontend error display
      - Update backend error middleware
      - Add integration tests for error flows
    rationale: "Uses 'monorepo' scope when changes affect multiple packages"

  documentation:
    description: "Documentation update"
    type: "docs"
    scope: "project"
    subject: "Add Docker-based E2E testing guide"
    body: |
      Document the Docker-first approach for E2E tests with comparison
      to local testing. Includes troubleshooting section.
    rationale: "No tests needed for docs-only changes (TDD workflow exception)"

  breaking_change:
    description: "Breaking change with footer"
    type: "feat"
    scope: "backend"
    subject: "Change expense API response format"
    body: |
      Restructure expense response to include currency metadata and
      localized formatting hints for frontend consumption.

      BREAKING CHANGE: Response structure changed from flat to nested.
      Frontend must update ExpenseList component to access `expense.data`
      instead of top-level fields.
    rationale: "Breaking changes must include footer explaining migration path"

  build_dependency:
    description: "Dependency update"
    type: "build"
    scope: "frontend"
    subject: "Update Playwright to v1.56.1"
    body: |
      Update to latest Playwright version for improved stability.
      Update Docker image in Dockerfile.e2e accordingly.
    rationale: "Use 'build' type for dependency changes, mention impact on other files"

workflow_integration:
  description: "How to use this skill during TDD workflow commit phase"
  steps:
    - "After tests pass and code is formatted/linted"
    - "Stage your changes: git add ."
    - "Review changed files to determine scope (frontend/backend/monorepo/etc)"
    - "Choose appropriate type (feat/fix/refactor/test/docs/etc)"
    - "Write subject in imperative mood, be specific"
    - "Add body with bullet points for multi-change commits"
    - "Reference examples above for similar scenarios"

  command_template: |
    git commit -m "type(scope): Subject line under 72 chars

    - Bullet point explaining what changed
    - Another change or context
    - Mention tests added or updated

    Refs #issue_number (if applicable)"
