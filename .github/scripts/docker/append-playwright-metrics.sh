# Append Playwright build metrics to existing Docker cache metrics git note
# This script adds Playwright build information and final summary to the note
# created by capture-cache-metrics.sh
#
# Usage: ./append-playwright-metrics.sh <commit-sha> <cache-hit> <load-duration>
#   commit-sha: Git commit SHA to append note to
#   cache-hit: Whether base image cache was hit (true/false)
#   load-duration: Time to load/pull base image in seconds
#
# Environment variables required:
#   GITHUB_SHA: Git commit SHA
#   DOCKER_LOAD_DURATION: Time to load Docker base image
#   CACHE_SOURCE: Source of cache (restored/pulled_and_saved/pulled_save_failed)
#   TAR_FILE_SIZE_MB: Size of cached tar file in MB
#   DOCKERFILE_HASH: Hash of Dockerfile.e2e
